                           <p>When you talk to Naveen (owner of MC/BC) you realize you are dealing with a bullet aficionado rather than a customiser who is just trying to squeeze money out of you...Not to mention the amazing designs and the value for money deals you can get...Where else would you get a Harley look-alike for 60-80 thousand? Highly recommended for Royal Enfield Lovers!&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;(Nazia Chishty Khan)<br><br>
